Have you ever wondered why you seem to encounter the same groups of people every day? This is a result of the social segregation phenomenon, an invisible map that shapes our daily interactions and experiences. Traditionally, researchers have attempted to decode this map by focusing on where people live. However, this approach doesn't fully capture the constant ebb and flow of urban life. To tackle this, we're using a cutting-edge approach called spatiotemporal data mining. In simple terms, "spatiotemporal" refers to analyzing where and when people move, and "data mining" is about digging out the hidden patterns in this information. We gather data from sources like smartphone usage logs (shown in Figure 1), which offer a real-time snapshot of the city's pulse. Then, we employ sophisticated techniques to unearth patterns, such as how different groups utilize spaces at different times. This approach allows us to view social segregation in a more dynamic and detailed manner. The goal of our research is to not only better understand the intricate web of social segregation but also find strategies to encourage more social interaction and inclusivity in our cities. After all, the first step towards solving a problem is understanding it!
